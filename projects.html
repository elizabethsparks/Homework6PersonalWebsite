            The projects I am most proud of include a project from my Database class and creating a website using PHP and Wordpress.
            In both cases, I had to learn a completely new system, which was a great learning experience.

        <div class="databaseproject">
            The database project included creating a database completely from scratch and importing data into the tables.
            I also had to create a database diagram and link up all of the tables so tha queries could be successfully run.

        <div class="websiteproject">
            Creating the website with PHP and Wordpress was also very challenging. I learned how to manipulate PHP code in order to create the kind of design that you want. I found it very similar to HTML.
