    <div class="introduction">
           
            My name is Elizabeth Sparks and I am currently a senior at The University of Oklahoma.
            I am double majoring in Management Information Systems and Entrepreneurship.
            I chose these two majors because I wanted to combine both technical and creative thinking skills.
